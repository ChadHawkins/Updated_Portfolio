            <p>
                Welcome!
                <br>
                 So I guess there's more you're keen on knowing... let's start from the begining, shall we?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Directly after matriculating, responsibilities led me to pursue a role in sales (insurance) of which I developed a passion for <span>Leading</span>
                a team and allowing them to achieve their goals, however after 3 years I decided that sales is not what I want to do with the rest of my life, so I 
                decided to pursue my "farfetched" dream and study to become a <span>Frontend Developer</span>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My goal is to learn core coding languages (Python being my #1) and pushing myself to evolve, not only personally but also professionally. I aim to 
                improve the company who gives me these opportunities.
